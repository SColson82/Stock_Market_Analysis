# VBA Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street
<hr>

  In this homework, a relatively small set of test data was analyzed for yearly and percent change as well as total stock volume over a set of stock tickers. Additionally, that analysis was used to determine the greatest stock percentage increase and decrease for each set of data provided as well as the stock with the greatest total volume. The written script was then applied to the larger dataset for the possibility of further analysis. Screen shots of each year of the larger dataset have been provided as JPEG files (2014_StockAnalysis.JPG, 2015_StockAnalysis.JPG, 2016_StockAnalysis.JPG) with the script (StockAnalysis.vbs) and the spreadsheets can be found in the VBA_Resources folder (Sharon_Multiple_Year_Stock_Data.xlsm and Sharon_alphabetical_testing.xlsm).
